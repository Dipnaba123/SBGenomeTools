Installation
To install ATOMIC from GitHub, you'll need to use the remotes package. If you haven't already installed remotes, you can do so by running:

``R
Copy code
install.packages("remotes")
Once you have remotes installed, you can install ATOMIC by running the following command:

``R
Copy code
remotes::install_github("sb-genome/ATOMIC")
Usage
Here's a quick example to get you started with using ATOMIC:

``R
Copy code
# Load the ATOMIC package
library(ATOMIC)

# Load your omics datasets (e.g., gene expression data)
data <- read.csv("your_omics_data.csv")

# Perform differential expression analysis
de_results <- perform_differential_expression(data)

# Visualize the results
plot(de_results)
